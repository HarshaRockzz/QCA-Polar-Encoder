# QCA-Polar-Encoder

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Polar Encoder using Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology. Polar codes are a type of error-correcting code that can achieve channel capacity, and QCA is a promising nanotechnology for building low-power, high-density digital circuits.
